    <h3>Coding and Language Switch</h3>

      "If we switched coding and language all of the elements of face to face communication like facial expressionand tone of voice would be lost. A more mechanical, 
      emotionless form of communication would be relied on instead. The statement made by Postmann and Weingarten would change becasue coding cannot be the "mediator 
      of all human perception," without those crucial emotional elements of perception would not be complete. Perception involves understanding that is based on both 
      meaning as wel as feeling and coding only allows for meaning." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"></a>
